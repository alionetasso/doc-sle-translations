"LVM enables flexible distribution of hard disk space over several physical "
"volumes (hard disks, partitions, LUNs). It was developed because the need to "
"change the segmentation of hard disk space might arise only after the "
"initial partitioning has already been done during installation. Because it "
"is difficult to modify partitions on a running system, LVM provides a "
"virtual pool (volume group or VG) of storage space from which logical "
"volumes (LVs) can be created as needed. The operating system accesses these "
"LVs instead of the physical partitions. Volume groups can span more than one "
"disk, so that several disks or parts of them can constitute one single VG. "
"In this way, LVM provides a kind of abstraction from the physical disk space "
"that allows its segmentation to be changed in a much easier and safer way "
"than through physical repartitioning."

"A logical volume can be created with several mirrors. LVM ensures that data "
"written to an underlying physical volume is mirrored onto a different "
"physical volume. Thus even though a physical volume crashes, you can still "
"access the data on the logical volume. LVM also keeps a log file to manage "
"the synchronization process. The log contains information about which volume "
"regions are currently undergoing synchronization with mirrors. By default "
"the log is stored on disk and if possible on a different disk than are the "
"mirrors. But you may specify a different location for the log, for example "
"volatile memory."
